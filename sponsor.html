<h2>Support Code for San Francisco</h2>

<p class="lead">
  We believe in civic innovation, open data, and open source collaboration.
</p>

<p>
  Code for San Francisco is a community searching for technological solutions to social challenges. We are an all
  volunteer group of technologists, designers, coders, data scientists, and engaged citizens. Our weekly hack night is
  open to anyone interested in making San Francisco a better city. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/">See what
  a typical night looks like.</a>
</p>

<p>
  We depend on the generous support of local organizations to help us run events and for our projects to accomplish
  their goals. When you donate to Code for San Francisco, you’re supporting the creation of civic technology solutions
  for the local community.
</p>

  If you are interested in supporting our organization, <strong>please reach out via <a

<h3>How we work</h3>

<p>
  Our weekly hack nights offer the San Francisco civic tech community a safe space for experimentation, learning and
  practicing skills, taking chances, and asking questions, all to effect and encourage positive change. Whenever
  possible, we proactively reach out to those who are left out, excluded, ignored, or discriminated against. We fail
  without their involvement.
</p>

<p>
  Can’t make it to hack night? Our projects are organized through Slack and Github. Remote volunteers are welcome.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to our weekly hack nights which draw ~50 participants, we also hold special events througout the year
  including:
</p>

  <li>
    Demo nights twice a year to showcase what our volunteers have been working on (<a

        Launched in October 2016, the Adopt a Drain Program enables San Francisco residents to "adopt" one of the City's
        25,000 storm drains, keeping it free of debris. While helping to reduce localized flooding, the program also
        fosters community engagement by encouraging San Franciscans to take an active role in improving their
        neighborhood.

      <p>
        It has since been adopted by the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission.
