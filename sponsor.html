<h2>Support Code for San Francisco</h2>

<p>
  Code for San Francisco is a community searching for technological solutions to social challenges. We are an all
  volunteer group of technologists, designers, coders, data scientists, and engaged citizens. Our weekly hack night is
  open to anyone interested in making San Francisco a better city. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/">See our about
    page to learn even more</a>
</p>

<p>
  We believe in civic innovation, open data, and open source collaboration.
</p>

<p>
  We depend on the generous support of local organizations to help us run events and for our projects to accomplish
  their goals. When you donate to Code for San Francisco, you’re supporting the creation of civic technology solutions
  for the local community.

<h3>How we work</h3>

<p>
  Our weekly hack nights offer the San Francisco civic tech community a safe space for experimentation, learning and
  practicing skills, taking chances, and asking questions, all to effect and encourage positive change. Whenever
  possible, we proactively reach out to those who are left out, excluded, ignored, or discriminated against. We fail
  without their involvement.
</p>

<p>
  Can’t make it to hack night? Our projects are organized through Slack and Github. Remote volunteers are welcome.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to our weekly hack nights which draw ~50 participants, we also hold special events througout the year
  including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Demo nights twice a year to showcase what our volunteers have been working on (<a
