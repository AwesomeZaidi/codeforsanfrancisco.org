Join us for another celebration of open data! For the seventh time in history, [groups from around the
world](http://opendataday.org/#map) will be gathering to show the benefits of open data and encourage the adoption of
open data policies in government, business and civil society.

It'll be a day of learning, experimenting, and exploring what's possible when companies and governments open their data.

This year, the global themes are: **Open Research Data**, **Tracking Public Money Flows**, **Open Mapping**, and **Data
for Equal Development**, but all projects leveraging open data are welcome!

In addition to hacking, we will have opportunities to learn about open data from government officials and discuss how
open data can be used to improve our communities.

**Who?** Neighbors, designers, engineers, data scientists and people living/working in SF

**Why?** Raising awareness of open data and finding creative insights and solutions to civic issues through its use

**What?** Solving issues both local, regional, and worldwide through the use of open data

We are gathering available resources and problem statements on a [collaborative
document](https://hackmd.io/KbDMCMAYE5IMwLQEMlwBwICwGNKQbKAOzLBpwAm4AbNmmkUkA===?both#) in advance of the event.
