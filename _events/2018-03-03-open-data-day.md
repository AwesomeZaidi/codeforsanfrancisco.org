Join us for another annual celebration of open data! For the seventh time in history, [groups from around the
world](http://opendataday.org/#map) will be gathering to show the benefits of open data and encourage the adoption of
open data policies in government, business and civil society.  It'll be a day of learning, experimenting, and exploring
what's possible when companies and governments open their data.

This year, the global themes are: **Open Research Data**, **Tracking Public Money Flows**, **Open Mapping**, and **Data
for Equal Development**, but all projects leveraging open data are welcome!

We will have opportunities:

* work on projects
* learn about open data from government officials
* discuss how open data can be used to improve our communities

The afternoon format will have space for
[unconference-style](https://medium.com/responsive-org/how-to-run-an-un-conference-92e7cf089831) sessions led by
participants on topics important to them. This could be anything from exploring an open data set to answer questions to
workshops on tools related to open data. We will collect and vote on suggestions the day-of, so please bring your ideas!

**Who?** Neighbors, designers, engineers, data scientists and people living/working in SF

**Why?** Raising awareness of open data and finding creative insights and solutions to civic issues through its use

**What?** Solving issues both local, regional, and worldwide through the use of open data

We are gathering available resources and problem statements on a [collaborative
document](https://hackmd.io/KbDMCMAYE5IMwLQEMlwBwICwGNKQbKAOzLBpwAm4AbNmmkUkA===?both#) in advance of the event.

### Keynote

The **Intersection of Data and Municipal Efforts** and how Fix-It has used data to inform decisions like how to
prioritize fixes based on crime and cleanliness data and track and monitor our work, post intervention.

[Sandra Zuniga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandra-zuniga-a64b732a/) is the Fix-It Director for the City of San
Francisco. Appointed by the late Mayor Ed Lee in 2016 to lead his Safe and Clean Neighborhoods Promise Initiative,
Sandraâ€™s work brings both qualitative and quantitative data together to make sound decisions to improve neighborhood
quality of life. As Fix-It Director, Sandra works with 7 different City agencies to implement  both quick and
sustainable fixes in San Francisco, and has championed a number of innovative projects and civic efforts directly
informed by unique data analysis. Prior to her appointment she worked at San Francisco Public Works for 8 years, most
recently as Central Operations Manager, where she oversaw community engagement, enforcement and apprenticeship
employment programs offered by the department

### Lightning Talks

#### DataSF

**Jason Lally**

Quick intro and exploration of the [Open Data Portal](https://datasf.org/).

#### Datasette

**Simon Willison**

Datasette is a tool for publishing data to the internet as a browsable web interface and JSON API. It's a fast and easy
way to take some interesting data and host it somewhere in a way that enables applications to be built on top of it.
I'll show how I used it to build a search engine for trees in San Francisco using data from DataSF.

### Learning Opportunities

#### Open Data 101

_Jason Lally, Data Services Manager of [DataSF](https://datasf.org)_

Manager for the City of San Francisco.
