Join us and Code for America brigade members from across the country at 2nd annual National Advisory Council (NAC)
social the evening before the Code for America Summit.

**Note that this is in place of our usual Wednesday hack night and is across the bay in Oakland**

Grab a bite and a drink and chat with other passionate brigade members. Share our work, learn from others, and build
a stronger community together.

The NAC will also be on hand to answer any questions you might have and to chat.

This is happening at the end of [brigade training
day](https://www.notion.so/Brigades-at-Summit-Wiki-6c4ffcfe3cd64eb29a92c28cad98b9e5), but you do not need to be
attending brigade training day to come to the social.
