<p><b>At this Hack Night we will have a special guest speaker, author of <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/node/9300">The Responsive City</a>, Professor Stephen Goldsmith, who will discuss the research findings that led to his new book! So make sure to RSVP ASAP! </b><br/> 
<i>About the book: </i><br/>The Responsive City is a compelling guide to civic engagement and governance in the digital age that will help municipal leaders link important breakthroughs in technology and data analytics with age-old lessons of small-group community input to create more agile, competitive and economically resilient cities. The book is co-authored by Professor Stephen Goldsmith, director of Data-Smart City Solutions at Harvard Kennedy School, and Professor Susan Crawford, co-director of Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg penned the book’s foreword.</p> <p>Based on the authors’ experiences and extensive research, The Responsive City explores topics including:</p> <p><br/>• Building trust in the public sector and fostering a sustained, collective voice among communities;</p> <p><br/>• Using data-smart governance to preempt and predict problems while improving quality of life;</p> <p><br/>• Creating efficiencies and saving taxpayer money with digital tools; and</p> <p>• Spearheading these new approaches to government with innovative leadership.<br/> 
<i>Note: Professors Crawford and Goldsmith presented at Microsoft New York in October.
