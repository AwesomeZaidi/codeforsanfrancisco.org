<p>Before we get started hacking this week, we have an opportunity to learn about accessibility from guest speaker Matthew Arana, Senior Accessibility consultant at SSB BART Group.</p> <p>"The goal of a web site/application is one which can be used by all its visitors. Inaccessible web sites/applications pose significant barriers to people with disabilities. By understanding the most common issues, web content can be made accessible by everyone."</p> <p><br/>________________________</p> <p>Interested in helping San Francisco?
