<p>Interested in helping San Francisco? You have found the right place!</p> <p>This week we have a short presentation by united.vote! See details below.</p> <p>Join neighbors, government employees, designers, coders, students and more! Our weekly hack night is focused on civic tech and making government services better in San Francisco. We hack/build and learn together every Wednesday evening.</p> <p>• Contribute to the betterment of San Francisco</p> <p>• Build your own portfolio of work or work on someone else's cool project</p> <p>• Meet new (and different!) people</p> <p><b>This week's presentation: Liquid Democracy: True Democracy for the 21st Century</b></p> <p>We face an alarming lack of faith in our democratic institutions. US Congress approval ratings have fallen as low as 10% for the past decades. Among many promising ideas for fundamental reform, Liquid Democracy — a hybrid of Direct and Representative models based on proxy voting — can address the most pressing issues.</p> <p>Even more excitingly, we can transition to liquid democracy in a grassroots fashion. Rather than needing elected representatives to pass systemic reform against their own interests, we can put the decision in the hands of voters by running new "Liquid Democracy Candidates" pledged to this new model.</p> <p><a href="http://www.united.vote">www.united.vote</a> was created to let us start experimenting with and build support for liquid democracy. United makes it easy and safe for candidates to run for office championing this vision for healthier and more accountable representative governments.</p> <p><b>Speaker: David Ernst</b></p> <p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/725393335473463296/Q9q1xES0_400x400.jpg" /></p> <p>
