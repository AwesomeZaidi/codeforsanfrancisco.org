Join [Code for San Francisco](https://codeforsanfrancisco.org/), [dev/Mission](http://devmission.org/), and over 50
passionate, action-oriented community members for a day of translating San Francisco problems into workable, impactful
solutions.

Don't call it a hackathon. Sure, there will be code and wireframes, along with plenty of tasty snacks. But there will
also be learning, collaboration, and empathy as we work together to better San Francisco.

This year, we're excited to bring dev/Mission's tech equity mission together with Code for San Francisco's civic tech
mission at the National Day of Civic Hacking, and we hope you'll join us on this day of learning, community, and
creativity.

Highlights of the day:

* Plenty of space for projects, both new and old, to further their work
* A panel presentation from Code for America about the future of the civic tech movement
* The kick-off of the Code for San Francisco Fellowship program in partnership with dev/Mission and Microsoft
* And, of course, free food: breakfast, lunch, and dinner

We're looking for hackers and doers of all kinds to join us â€” not just developers & designers, but City & County staff,
community activists, and people on the street who want to improve our neighborhoods. Real people. Real problems. Come
for the community, meaningful work, and good times... stay for the free food and non-alcoholic beverages.

## Program

We'll kickoff the day with an introduction and keynote to set the tone and wrap time for prototyping, hacking and
networking. We'll bring all the great ideas and energy back to our weekly hack nights, which are [every Wednesday
night](http://codeforsanfrancisco.org/).  We invite you to continue working with us here after National Day.

We're most excited about the launch of the new fellowship program with dev/Mission. We invite participants to offer
encouragement, feedback and mentorship to the fellows you'll meet during the day.

<strong>Parallel tracks are delimited with a pipe ( | ). Subject to changes.</strong>

### 8:00 AM Breakfast
Doors open and breakfast provided!

### 9:00 AM Introduction
Join the Code for San Francisco organizing team to kickoff the day.

#### Keynote: Leonardo Sosa
Leonardo Sosa will set the tone with a keynote about [dev/Mission](http://devmission.org/)'s mission and how it relates
to the work we do as volunteer civic technologists.

In early 2017, was founded by Leonardo Sosa and a team of technologists, that care about STEM opportunities for untapped
young adults. Their goal is to connect the most overlooked population in San Francisco, Bay Area and beyond; and expose
them to careers in the tech industry. We're excited to bring 's tech equity mission together with Code for San
Francisco's civic tech mission at the National Day of Civic Hacking, and we hope you'll join us on this day of learning,
community, and creativity.

#### Announcing Code for San Francisco Fellowship Fellows
We officially kick-off the start of the fellow's 6-month tenure working on projects within Code for San Francisco. The
selected fellows will introduce themselves and begin the start of their six month tenure working on projects at Code for
San Francisco.

We will encourage existing Code for SF members and new experienced technologists to volunteer to help mentor the fellows
for the remainder of the day: shedding light on what it means to be a professional in this space as well as how you got
there.

#### Project pitches
An opportunity for attending Code for San Francisco projects to pitch what they'll be working on throughout the day.
Attendees will be invited to collaborate and work on projects throughout the rest of the day.

You are also welcome to bring new projects, but they must:

* Be for the public good; could benefit local government, non-profits, community associations, etc.
* Be open source if your project involves code; meaning in a public repository with an appropriate open license
* Respect our [code of conduct](http://codeforsanfrancisco.org/about/code-of-conduct)
* Not be political or partisan; we are an affiliate of a non-partisan organization and cannot support or endorse
* specific parties or candidates

If you have a project to pitch, [fill out the form](https://goo.gl/forms/Xqocp83vJ07kPNUA2) so we can plan for the day.

### 10:30 AM Open Data 101 | Projects

involved.

### 1:00 PM Reconvening
Having put the ideas and skills together, we have a few hours to build momentum on these projects inspired by the
morning's activities. While we don't expect complete solutions in a couple hours, we'll have the chance to scope and
build a kernel for projects that can continue at Code for SF weekly hack night or wherever you wish. We'll bring people
back together to report out at 5.
