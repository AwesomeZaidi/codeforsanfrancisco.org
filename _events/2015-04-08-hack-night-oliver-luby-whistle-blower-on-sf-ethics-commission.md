<p><b>Come hear about Oliver Luby's experience working at the <a href="http://www.sfethics.org/">San Francisco Ethics Commission</a>. </b>SF Bay Guardian describes him as "the one person in [the SF Ethics Commission] who repeatedly exposed powerful violators of campaign finance rules and blew the whistle on schemes to make the system less transparent and effective." We are excited to better understand the role of whistle blowers in local government, the unique challenges they face, and help the civic tech community gain insights into potential tech solution to encourage local whistle blower activity.</p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Want to build tools that improve your city, community, and government? </b></p> <p><br/>Are you passionate about your community?
