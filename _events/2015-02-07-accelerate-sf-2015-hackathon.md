<p><a href="http://developerweek.com/">DeveloperWeek 2015</a> is kicking off with a two-day <a href="http://developerweek.com/hackathon/">Accelerate SF</a> hackathon - the nation's largest challenge-driven hackathon. It's a great place to continue your civic hacking and possibly win some cash prizes!</p> <p><br/><b>HOW IT WORKS</b></p> <p><br/>#1 Build a new startup</p> <p>Participants can build any startup app idea (from scratch) over 30 hours. You can network with our mentors to get tech help and feedback - and proceed through 2 rounds of judging!</p> <p>#2 Solve Crowd Challenges</p> <p>Help solve real-world problems and browse through dozens of crowd-powered or sponsored challenges on Accelerate.im! Many of these challenges have prizes specific to Accelerate Sf 2015</p> <p><br/>#3 Build Product Add-ons</p> <p><br/>Many of our sponsors will be offering prizes specific to tech companies who build a new product feature or add-on to their existing technology during the 30-hour hackathon!</p> <p><br/>#4 Donate 30 hours</p> <p>Accelerate SF will have a list of non-profits who need design and development help. We are asking participants to donate 30 hours to help one of these non-profits solve technology challenges!</p> <p><br/>#5 Company Prototyping</p> <p><br/>We invite companies to host mini-hackathons inside of Accelerate SF where your company team can internally hack and build prototypes over 30 hours using our facilities and lounge area! You can make the apps private or public .</p> <p><b>RULES</b></p> <p>• Teams can build apps from scratch (Mobile App / Consumer Web App / Business Web App) or they can build product add-ons using sponsor technology. You can also donate 30 hours to help a non-profit, but are not eligible for top 20 pitch spots.</p> <p>• Almost all hackathon prizes will be sponsor prizes. The sponsors will choose their own prizes and choose their own prize winners during Day 2 of the hackathon.</p> <p>• There will be 2 rounds of judging on Day 2. During Round One, judges will hear the pitches from all teams building on their technology and fill out a scoring sheet on each team.</p> <p>• The top 20 project teams will pitch on the main stage.</p> <p><br/><b><a href="http://developerweek.com/register/">REGISTER TODAY!</a></b> ($20 Hackathon+ Pass)</p> <p>***************************</p> <p>DeveloperWeek 2015 is San Francisco’s largest one-week tech event series with over 60 week-long events including the DeveloperWeek 2015 Conference &amp; Expo, <a href="http://developerweek.com/hackathon/">Accelerate 2015</a> (1,000+ attendee hackathon) <a href="http://girldevweek.com/">GirlDevWeek</a> Events, Robotics Dev Summit, DevOps Summit, <a href="http://developerweek.com/hiringmixer/">1,000+ attendee tech hiring mixer</a>, and 60+ city-wide workshops, open houses, drink-ups, across San Francisco!</p> <p>DeveloperWeek puts the spotlight on new dev technologies.
