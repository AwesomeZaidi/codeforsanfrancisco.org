<p><b>For many, housing policy can be dry and wonky. Jodi Medeiros, Deputy Director of <a href="http://www.sfhac.org/">San Francisco Housing Action Coalition</a>, </b>will unpack two important pieces of San Francisco housing legislation that will help produce more middle-income housing. These will soon be introduced soon at the Board of Supervisors. Come to learn more, ask questions, and find out how you can take action. Feel free to check out SFHAC’s latest blog post about the <a href="http://www.sfhac.org/housing-policy-update/">Inclusionary Dial and Off-Site Inclusionary Reform</a>.<br/>
