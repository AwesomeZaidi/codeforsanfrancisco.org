Interested in helping San Francisco? You have found the right place!

Join neighbors, government employees, designers, coders, students and more! Our weekly hack night is focused on civic
tech and making government services better in San Francisco. We hack/build and learn together every Wednesday evening.

* Contribute to the betterment of San Francisco
* Build your own portfolio of work or work on someone else's cool project
* Meet new (and different!) people

## The Constituent

This week, Michael Pierce will be joining us to do a short demo of [The Constituent](https://theconstituent.net).

Ever surprised by SF politics? Discuss San Francisco legislation online before the Board of Supervisors vote. This
April, I'll publicly launch the first iteration of Constituent. Sign up for the email list to be one of the first
contributors: [https://theconstituent.net](https://theconstituent.net).

I'm pulling in all SF city legislation data every day and providing an easy-to-use platform for people to discuss
legislation as it moves through the system. Representatives and candidates will participate as well, voicing their
opinions and building consensus alongside their constituents.

**About Michael**: Based in San Francisco. Programmer, designer, and business owner since 2010.
