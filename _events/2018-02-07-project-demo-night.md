Want to see how volunteers are using technology to tackle hard challenges in
San Francisco? Code for SF is hosting a demo night of the projects our members
are building.

Project leaders will give a 3-5 minute presentation and pitch: the problem they
are solving, solution they are building, and next steps/opportunities for
involvement with plenty of time before and after for chatting.
