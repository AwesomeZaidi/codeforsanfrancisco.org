<p>Join Dev Bootcamp for its January Civic-Themed Hackathon!</p> <p>Join a team on-site to make something new come to life or come prepared with a new idea and your Code for SF friends.</p> <p>This event is open to the whole SF tech community. We'll also have beginner coding workshops alongside the event. Teams and project ideas will be formed Saturday morning, based on skill level and interest. If you would like to come with a pre-formed team and idea, please reserve 2 spots for additional members to be assigned at the kickoff.</p> <p>Judges will be made up of industry influencers and civic leaders. Food, fun and prizes will be had by all. Bring your ideas and computers with you. Please RSVP ASAP on Eventbrite, so we know how much food to buy. We have limited slots available.</p> <p>**Breakfast, lunch, and dinner will be provided.**</p> <p>We are charging for this hackathon - proceeds will help cover some of the food costs. The remainder will be donated to us civic hackers at Code for San Francisco to help continue the projects we're working on!</p> <p>*If the cost of the event will prohibit you from attending, please contact the organizer, Andrew ([masked]). Accommodations will be made confidentially, if need be. <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/dev-bootcamp-january-hackathon-tickets-20492497612?aff=es2" class="linkified">http://www.eventbrite.com/e/dev-bootcamp-january-hackathon-tickets-20492497612?aff=es2</a></p>
