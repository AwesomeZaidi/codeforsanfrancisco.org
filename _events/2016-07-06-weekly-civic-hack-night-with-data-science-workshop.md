<p><b>NOTE: Hack Night will be at the Microsoft Reactor this week!</b></p> <p>We are organizing a workshop this week for those of you who are interested in learning Data Science and working with <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/">San Francisco Open Data</a>. For those of you who want to come and hack away at regular projects, you are welcome to do so.</p> <p>Sameer Farooqui from <a href="http://www.databricks.com">Databricks</a> will present a hands-on workshop on <b><i>how to use <a href="http://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a> to analyze SF OpenData datasets</i></b>. The workshop will focus on how to use Spark SQL and DataFrames to retrieve insights and visualizations from the data. The demos and labs are targeted for an audience with some general programming or sql query experience, but little to no experience with Spark. The workshop is broken into two sections, 45 mins each. The first section contains theory, lecture and live demos while the second section encourages you to use the data hands on in lab exercises.</p> <p><i>Each participant will receive a free login to <a href="https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/registration.html#signup/community">Databricks Community Edition</a> (w/ unlimited usage of a 6 GB Spark Cluster in Amazon's Cloud).
