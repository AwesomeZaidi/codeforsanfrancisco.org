<p><b>CityCamp returns to San Francisco! </b><a href="http://citycamp.com">CityCamp</a> is a national movement that brings together local citizens to build stronger communities where they live. Local governments and community organizations have the most direct influence to make cities more open and “user friendly," and CityCamp provides a space for that to happen.</p> <p><a href="http://citycamp.com/sf/">CityCampSF</a> will be an all-day unconference for citizens of all stripes to come together to share perspectives and insights about their city by the Bay. As an unconference, content is created and organized by participants and coordinated by facilitators. Participants play active roles in sessions which provides an excellent format for creative, open exchange geared toward action.</p> <p>CityCampSF will:</p> <p>•  Provide space for local government officials and staff, community organizations, developers, designers, citizens, and journalists to share perspectives and insights about their cities</p> <p>• Foster communities of practice and advocacy on the role of the Internet, mobile communication, online information, and open data in cities</p> <p>• Create outcomes that participants will act upon related to pressing issues facing San Francisco, including: open government, economic development, housing, transportation, resiliency, and education.</p> <p>Breakfast, lunch, coffee, and snacks will be provided, as well as beer and wine during the CityCampSF closing party.
