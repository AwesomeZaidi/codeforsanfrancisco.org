This is data the FBI collects from nearly 18,000 law enforcement agencies from across the country as part of the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program.</p> <p>18F helped the FBI design and build a new service, called the Crime Data Explorer (CDE), that makes this dataset more transparent and easier to work with. The CDE consists of a web interface for viewing high-level trends at the national, state, and local levels, as well as bulk downloads and an open API for more detailed views of the data.</p> <p>You can view the CDE at <a href="https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/"><a href="https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/" class="linkified">https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/</a></a> and check out our public repo at: <a href="https://github.com/18F/crime-data-explorer."><a href="https://github.com/18F/crime-data-explorer" class="linkified">https://github.com/18F/crime-data-explorer</a>.</a></p> <p>Amber and Larry will share their lessons learned from working with the FBI on their first open source project and offer a few strategies for working with government entities that are new to agile and human centered design.</p> <p>Fore more information on the project, check out the CDE at <a href="https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/"><a href="https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/" class="linkified">https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/</a></a> and our public repo at: <a href="https://github.com/18F/crime-data-explorer."><a href="https://github.com/18F/crime-data-explorer" class="linkified">https://github.com/18F/crime-data-explorer</a>.</a></p> <p><b>Interested in our <a href="http://codeforsanfrancisco.org/projects/">current projects</a>?</b></p> <p><b>This week</b></p> <p>Hacking with CivicMakers, WeVote, OpenReferral, Data Science Team, Adopt-A-Drain, and many more.</p> <p><b>Schedule</b></p> <p>6:00p doors open, socialize and eat dinner</p> <p>6:30p welcome remarks, project pitches, and Crime Data Explorer Presentation</p> <p>7:00p start hacking or stay for new member orientation</p> <p>8:00p more hacking</p> <p>9:00p keep on hacking</p> <p>10:00p doors close and lights out.</p> <p>Check out our <a href="http://codeforsanfrancisco.org/">website</a>.
