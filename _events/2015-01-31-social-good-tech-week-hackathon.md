<b>What is a hackathon?</b></p> <p>

Hackathon is an event where people come together to collaboratively build and launch mobile or web apps aimed at solving a particular problem. They usually work in small groups of up-to five people over a day or two, the aim is to come up with a prototype at the end of the hackathon.</p> <p>

<b>But I do not know how to program/code.</b></p> <p>

Learn to Code with Snap! - UC Berkeley’s online drag and drop programming language used in their programming for non-Computer Science majors course “The Beauty and Joy of Computing.” We’ll cover the basics and then spend time helping everyone working on their own mini projects that can be shared online after the hackathon.</p> <p>

<b>Who is eligible to attend?</b></p> <p>

Anyone &amp; Everyone who is interested in creating tech solutions for good!  Experience Programmers to individuals who want to learn what coding/programming is all about!!  Bring a friend!</p> <p>

<b>What do I bring?</b></p> <p>

A laptop and amazing social change tech ideas.  We provide everything else. We have limited amount of laptops to lend out to participants who do not own a laptop.</p> <p><i>This event is not sponsored or hosted by the Code for SF Brigade.</i></p>
