# Speaker submissions

Have a talk you'd like to give at Code for San Francisco? [Let us know!](mailto:hello@codeforsanfrancisco.org)

Code for San Francisco presentations come in two flavors:

* **Short presentation during the opening**. These presentations are 10 minutes or
  less in length with an limited Q&A session afterwards. These occur during the
  opening remarks.
* **Long presentation or workshop after the break**. These presentations are can be
	anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour in length with an open Q&A session
	afterwards. Because of their length, we give attendees a chance to optionally
	use the time to work on their projects.

Presenters can be any government agency, non-profit, company or
group who've made use of data and/or technology to improve the public good.

The Code for San Francisco audience typically consists of a diverse group of
50+ web developers, designers, academic researchers, activists, policy wonks
and curious citizens.

A few rules of thumb for a good presentation:

* Show, don’t tell
* Be honest about what worked and what didn’t
* Don’t try to sell us your product or agenda
* Attend a Hack Night prior to your talk and get a feel for the community
