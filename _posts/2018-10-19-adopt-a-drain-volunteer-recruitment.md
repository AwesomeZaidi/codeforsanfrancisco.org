  Code for San Francisco's Adopt-a-Drain project is looking for new volunteers to pick up the mantle of our ongoing
  collaboration with the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission.

---

Since 2015, Code for San Francisco has been collaborating with the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission to create
and administer [Adopt-a-Drain](https;//adoptadrain.sfwater.org): a volunteer program aimed at reducing flooding and
having more eyes on the streets of San Francisco; keeping them clean and well-maintained.

Recently, the author of this post and project lead, has moved from the city leaving space for a new volunteers to step
in and lead this project into its future.

**Why volunteer with Adopt-a-Drain?**

* Existing, strong, partnership with a City agency (Public Utilities Commission)
* Opportunity to take a leading role in bringing an already successful project into the future
* Very forkable project; enhancements here can be reused by other brigades

**Specific needs at this time include:**
* A dedicated project lead (technical or non-technical) that can act as the product manager
* Full-stack developers (ideally one lead)
* User research to identify ways to better engage drain adopters

But the project is open to whatever skills you might have to contribute! The main ask is interest and commitment.

If this interests you, please read on for more details and/or **reach out on Slack (in #adopt-a-drain) or via
[email](mailto:jesse@szwedko.me)** to chat more.

### Background

{% include youtube.html id="Z1Vjrx3IAH0" caption="Adopt-a-Drain in 30 seconds" %}

This project originated from a conversation at the Code for America Summit in 2015 between Jesse Biroscak (then brigade
captain), Jason Lally of DataSF, and Jean Walsh of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, about possible
use-cases for a dataset about to be published to the [Open Data Portal](https://datasf.org) containing information about
all of the City's storm drains. It was suggested that we could fork [Boston's
Adopt-a-Hydrant](http://www.adoptahydrant.org/) to let residents and businesses adopt local storm drains; keeping them
clear of debris to reduce the flooding that can be caused by obstructions.

After an initial sprint of feature development and customization, volunteers within Code for San Francisco created
a prototype within a month or so. Jean was able to use this to champion the project within the Public Utilities
Commission to create an official, funded, City volunteer program around it. The program officially launched in October
2016 complete with volunteer events and promotion via web, television, and mailers.

Since then, we have continued to iterate on the project, introducing more features and streamlining the user experience.
Most recently, we've updated the drain markers to indicate "drains-in-need". These are particularly problematic drains
as identified by the volume of calls to 311 to clean them.

For a more detailed history of the project and the challenges it faced, I highly encourage you to read [Alleviating
Flooding in San Francisco With Civic Tech
Volunteers](https://datasmart.ash.harvard.edu/news/article/alleviating-flooding-in-san-francisco-with-civic-tech-volunteers-1064).
It does an excellent job of covering both sides of the Adopt-a-Drain: the development of the web application as well as
the volunteer program.

### Opportunities

The past year has primarily been project maintenance and small feature development due to time constraints, but
I believe a fresh infusion of development energy could make a big impact on the next iteration of Adopt-a-Drain.

Some possibilities:

* **User Experience Improvements**: Recently the [Code for San Francisco UX
  Group](https://github.com/sfbrigade/research-group) did some amazing [user
  interviews and usability
  testing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MFvqfXVQFB9rtA4Kpq_e_3zFK4c3jfMm68aCyEJZQIw/edit#slide=id.g415a1cdab7_0_131).
  There is a lot of low hanging fruit in terms of improvements that could be made.
* **User Engagement**: Conducting additional user research to understand how we might engage drain adopters more. Maybe allow them to share
  on social media? Upload photos? Record when they've cleared their drain.
* **Rain Guardians**: In addition to Adopt-a-Drain itself, the UX Research Group has recently undertaken design research
  to understand how we might develop a new application as part of Rain Guardians, a new Public Utilities Commission
  initiative to allow residents to adopt their local rain gardens.
* **Metrics**: Better tracking of how users currently engage with the site.
* **Your ideas here!**
