# browser

A fast browser for the SF Code.

This is a much simpler and less feature-rich system that more developed
stuff like [The State Decoded](http://www.statedecoded.com/), but ideally
is either a proof-of-concept of a fully static approach or at least a useful
tool for proofing [our parser](https://github.com/openlawdc/dc-decoded).

This site takes a [static approach](http://macwright.org/2013/01/08/thinking-static.html)
to the task. It's hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).

## Setup

    git clone git@github.com:sfbrigade/sf-admin-code.git
