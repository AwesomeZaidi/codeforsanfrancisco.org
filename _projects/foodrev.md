While so many live in food-insecure households here in the US and elsewhere in the world, we see tragically  (often out of false fears of litigation\*) that 40% of the food created in the US is just tossed away.

That's where foodRev comes in, partners with food-businesses who would like to instead donate their massive amounts of food items and pre-packaged meals and deliver to families in need. 

We're technology driven intiative, and our technical team is comprised of Data Scientists, ML experts, Server-Side Engineers, Mobile and Web developers who constantly innovating methods for removing obstacles for businesses to donate to the needy.
