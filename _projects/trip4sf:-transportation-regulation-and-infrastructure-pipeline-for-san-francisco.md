Changes to transportation regulation and infrastructure in our public right of way, on our streets and sidewalks, is of interest to a wide variety of individuals and organizations.

Proposed changes administered by the SF Municipal Transportation Agency, are subject to public notification, public hearing, and formal approvals by SFMTA staff and Board of Directors. Staff and Board meeting agendas and minutes document change details.

We are developing a pipeline to track the processing of proposals and to facilitate communication about them.

Our focus is on the locations for vehicle and pedestrian movement primarily in the public right of way. Public transit equipment, the electrical infrastructure, and operation facilities are not included.
